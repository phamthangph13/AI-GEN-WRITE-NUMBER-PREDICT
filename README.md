# AI-GEN-WRITE-NUMBER-PREDICT

The provided Python script is a machine learning application that uses a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Here's a breakdown of the script's functionality:
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The script begins by importing necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, and PIL.
It loads the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.
The pixel values of the images are normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0.
Data Augmentation:
A data augmentation pipeline is created using Keras' Sequential model, which includes random rotations and zooms to artificially expand the training dataset and improve model generalization.
3. Model Construction:
A sequential neural network model is built with Keras. It consists of:
A flatten layer to convert 2D images into 1D vectors.
Two dense layers with ReLU activation, where the first has 256 neurons and the second has 128 neurons.
A dropout layer with a rate of 0.3 to prevent overfitting.
A final dense layer with a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each of the 10 digit classes.
Model Compilation and Training:
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss function.
It is trained on the augmented training data for 200 epochs.
5. Model Evaluation:
The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to determine its accuracy.
Image Prediction:
The script reads an external image file (image.png), converts it to grayscale, resizes it to 28x28 pixels, and normalizes it.
The model predicts the digit in the image, and the result is displayed using Matplotlib.
This script is a complete example of a machine learning pipeline for digit recognition, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, and finally, making predictions on new data.
